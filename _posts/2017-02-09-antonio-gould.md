## Antonio Gould

Today in our interaction design workshop we were lucky enough to enjoy a presentation from
Antonio Gould, a project manager specialising in education. He is part of the team behind 
Teach your Monster to Read - an awesome game that assists in teaching school children to read.

### tl;dr
- Having a well thought out design process is imperative to a sucessful product or service
- When designing something innovative, it's important to ensure the design also has purpose.
- Basically, worship the design process. Experiment with it, play with it. Your design process
 is your best friend and whilst it'll be different for everyone, there are certain steps that
 are tried and tested.

### Presentation Notes
- Some things are about optimization as opposed to innovation

- Design problem - solution - show journey (workings)

#### Key process elements:

- Have a good definition of the problem trying to solve
- Be thorough about research and techniques (competitor analysis, product research)
- Research to expand your knowledge and learn as much as possible
- Sense making - bring research together - map into different opportunities and evaluate - which will work best (take to users and find which works best for you) end up with potential solutions

- Intended user - specify! ( don’t go for ‘everyone’ )
- Needs - people aren’t generally designers, this doesn’t mean they cant give intersting insights
- Figure out how you talk to these people and study them to find their unmet needs
- IDEO has an HCD toolkit, it's worth checking out

#### Design principles: 

- Iterate / prototype (test test test test again)
- Simplicity > Complexity 
- Understand the core user experience of your design
- When adding features, ask why. Can we strip it out?
- Question every feature
- When asked to put bad idea in, say that you can put this in but will need to take something else out due 
to limited time - one goes in, one goes out
- Too many features can lead to a poor user experience
- As an exercise, imagine each design feature costs £1000 - is each feature worth it?
- Being critical will annoy people who don’t care about good design, that's okay.
- Clients will already have an idea and love it - break it down and find the useful insight 
in their solution ( ideas beneath the surface of their solution ) - ask 'why' again and again. 

#### Why is design important?
- De risk the process
- Massively increase the change of product success
- Avoids conflict - having research backs up your ideas

#### Practice makes perfect:
- Try different techniques
- Personal projects
- Don’t worry if it’s overblown, better to err on the side of too much

#### Suggested Reading:
- Service design
- Lean (the lean startup book was mentioned)
- Product Management

#### Q&A:

During the Q&A I asked Antonio two questions. Firstly: 

#### When you have identified a problem to which there are multiple groups of potential users, how do you decide which target audience to design for?
To sum up his answer, he said that there are various factors that can help you decide
on who your target audience is:
- Which target audience do you have more experience with?
- Which can we do the best job for?
- Are there other projects based at any of the audiences?
- How accessible are the groups when it comes to research?
- Do we have expertise in designing for any of these groups?
- Are any of these groups already well served?
- Be critical why you have chosen a target audience.

#### How do you know when a product or service is ready to be deployed?

- When the basic core interaction of your design is functioning, it is probably ready for first release.
- The lean startup book says that early adopters are people who just want use new things and don’t care
 if its finished. They don't really mind if features are missing. You can get a fundamental idea of whether it 
 works or not.
- Deploy when the essentials are there - more features are harder to maintain
- Be very critical and deploy as early as possible

Finally, his advice for preparing for interviews was:

- At beginning of process - ask super broad open questions and get people 
to draw maps for you i.e. ‘tell me the whole of this process’
- Later in process - focused and super targeted on the stuff you know you 
don’t know i.e gaps in knowledge. Focus questions on gaps in knowledge
- Keep every question tightly aligned with something you want to know
- Don’t think about questions, what do you not know that would be critical to find out?
