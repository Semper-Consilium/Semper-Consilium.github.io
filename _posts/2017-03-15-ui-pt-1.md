# Designing the UI
## The Months Slider

Our primary goal when designing the user interface was for it to be extremely easy to use. We wanted it to be absolutely clear which parts need to be clicked or dragged.

The first thing to design and build was the months slider. We wanted to allow users to click on a label and then toggle which month's data would be displayed on the visualisation. To do this, we used a simple HTML ranged input with some CSS used to customise how it looked. For the months, I created a list of items and aligned them correctly.

~~~
<div class="months-slider">
  <div class="range">
    <input type="range" 
           id="slider" 
           min="1" 
           max="12" 
           value="1" />
  </div>

  <ul class="range-labels" 
      id="months-list">

    <li class="month">Jan</li>
    <li class="month">Feb</li>
    <li class="month">Mar</li>
    <li class="month">Apr</li>
    <li class="month">May</li>
    <li class="month">Jun</li>
    <li class="month">Jul</li>
    <li class="month">Aug</li>
    <li class="month">Sep</li>
    <li class="month">Oct</li>
    <li class="month">Nov</li>
    <li class="month">Dec</li>
  </ul>
</div>

We agreed on using a dark colour scheme and so the colours used in the input elements and fonts needed to compliment this. I chose to use slightly muted colours. Instead of #FFFFFF for white, we used #F1F1F1.

JavaScript was used to give the labels and input correct functionality. The end result is that person can click on any month or drag the range to display data from different points in the year.
