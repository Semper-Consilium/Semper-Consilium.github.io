For this assignment, we've to choose some organisation or charity and do a similar task as last semester in that we create a product, be it an app or tool, to help that organisation or charity in their aim. We've decided to take a different route in that we're not choosing a charity, rather we've chosen a cause. We want to help make an ease of access to government political data for the public (REWORD THIS).

At the moment we're wanting to built a web based 3D data visualisation that the public can interact with to learn more about their MP's


This week:
Talked about why we wanted to present data to public
What kind of data we want to work with
Contacted our MP's to ask to chat about their opinions
Contacted Prakash about api's we could use for data sets

Next week:
Nail down what data sets we want to work with
Based on that data, decide what kind of interface we want to build
